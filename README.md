# Seinfield script generation

In this project, I will generate my own [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV scripts using [Recurrent Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network). I will be using a part of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network will generate a new "fake" TV script based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

Please see the [Jupyter notebook file](TV scripts generation.ipynb) in this repository.
